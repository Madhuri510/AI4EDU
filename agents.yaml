# YAML configuration for CrewAI agents using Azure OpenAI
#
# Each agent definition specifies its role, goal, backstory and the LLM to use.
# The `llm` field is set to an Azure model (e.g. azure/gpt-4o-mini). The value of
# the model will be automatically interpolated by the code using the environment
# variable `LITELLM_MODEL`.
#
# You can adjust the roles, goals and backstories as needed for your use‑case.
